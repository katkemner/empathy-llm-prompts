## Dimension 1: Self-Empathy & Emotional Self-Awareness

**1.1: The Emotional Archaeology Exercise**  
Guide me through a structured emotional archaeology exercise. I’ll describe a moment where I had a negative emotional reaction felt bigger than the situation. Then guide me through:  
- Body sensations I noticed  
- The story I told myself  
- What younger version of me this might have activated  
- What I needed but didn't receive in that moment

Finally, help me practice giving myself the compassion I needed. Use the RAIN technique: Recognize what's happening, Allow the experience to be there, Investigate with kindness, Nurture with self-compassion. After each step, help me deepen my self-understanding without judgment. Go step by step and always wait for me to respond before proceeding.

**1.2: The Inner Critic Dialogue**  
Help me map my inner critic's voice. I'll share something I'm struggling with or feeling bad about. Then help me:  
- Identify my critic's exact words and tone  
- Trace where this voice might have originated  
- Understand what the critic is trying to protect me from  
- Develop a compassionate inner mentor voice to respond

Practice with me until I can catch the critic mid-sentence and respond with self-empathy. Role-play both voices with me to help me hear the difference. Ask me: What protective function might my harsh self-judgment be serving? Go step by step and always wait for me to respond before proceeding.

**1.3: Somatic Self-Empathy Map**  
Guide me in creating a body map of my emotions. Guide me through a body scan while I recall different emotional experiences from the past week. For each emotion, help me identify:  
- Where I felt it in my body  
- What it felt like (texture, temperature, movement)  
- What my body needed in that moment  
- How to practice sending compassion to that body part now

Help me create a personalized 'body wisdom guide' that helps me recognize and respond to my emotional needs somatically. Point out which emotions I might rush past and which I linger in. Go step by step and always wait for me to respond before proceeding.

**1.4: The Self-Compassion Time Machine**  
Help me revisit a mistake or failure that still makes me cringe with radical self-compassion. First, I'll tell you what happened from my harshest critic's perspective. Then help me:  
- Find what I was needing/seeking in that moment  
- Identify what resources or support were missing  
- Write a letter to that past self from my wisest, most loving current self  
- Extract the lesson while releasing the shame

Show me how this self-compassion changes my ability to take responsibility without self-attack. Go step by step and always wait for me to respond before proceeding.

**1.5: Daily Emotional Weather Report**  
Help me develop a practice of checking my 'emotional weather' three times daily. For the next week, guide me through each check-in:  
- Naming the emotion without judgment  
- Rating its intensity  
- Identifying what it's telling me about my needs  
- Offering myself one kind response

Provide different self-compassion phrases for different emotional states. At week's end, help me analyze patterns: Which emotions do I judge? Which do I avoid? When is self-compassion hardest? Show me how this builds the foundation for recognizing these patterns in others. Go step by step and always wait for me to respond before proceeding.

**1.6: Shadow Empathy Exploration**  
Help me explore my empathy shadow. I'll describe times when:  
- I used empathy to manipulate or control  
- My empathy felt performative  
- I withheld empathy as punishment  
- Empathy became a way to avoid my own feelings

For each, help me explore: What was I protecting? What would genuine empathy have looked like? How can I catch these patterns early? Approach this without shame. Focus on honest self-awareness that prevents empathetic harm. Go step by step and always wait for me to respond before proceeding.

**1.7: Empathy Burnout Recovery Protocol**  
I'm experiencing empathy fatigue. Help me create a recovery plan:  
- Identify my depletion signals  
- Map which types of empathy drain me most  
- Design boundaries that preserve capacity  
- Practice 'empathetic fasting', deliberate breaks  
- Guide me to rebuild slowly with self-empathy first

Help me distinguish between healthy limits and defensive numbing. Remind me that sometimes the most empathetic thing is recognizing when I have nothing left to give. Go step by step and always wait for me to respond before proceeding.

**1.8: Caregiver Burnout Early Warning System**  
You must go step by step and wait for me to respond before proceeding. You must complete these steps one at a time and wait for a response before proceeding. I’m a caregiver at risk of burnout. Help me build a personalized early warning system to catch signs of burnout before crisis.

First, acknowledge the weight I may be carrying.

Remind me: Burnout isn’t weakness. It’s a natural response to unsustainable conditions.

Then, guide me to rate myself (Green = sustainable, Yellow = warning, Red = danger) across these 7 domains. For each, ask a reflective question and wait for my response before continuing:  
- Physical – sleep, energy, illness, tension  
- Emotional – numbness, irritability, tears, joy  
- Cognitive – focus, forgetfulness, cynicism  
- Behavioral – self-care, boundaries, habits  
- Spiritual – hope, values, meaning  
- Relational – presence, patience, connection  
- Resilience – what still gives me joy or energy?

Once we’ve mapped all seven, help me:  
- Spot my personal early warning signs  
- Create a daily 30-second scan  
- Give me a wellbeing score for each dimension and an overall score  
- Build weekly/monthly/quarterly prevention habits  
- Set 3 intervention levels (green to red)  
- Address moral injury (where I’m blocked from helping)

Finally, remind me: My well-being is not optional. It’s a form of care.

**1.9: The Outside-In Self-Witnessing Practice**  
You must go step by step and wait for me to respond before proceeding. Help me develop self-empathy by seeing myself from the outside. The goal of this exercise is to use a technique from attachment theory to help me develop a more integrated self-view.

Setup Phase: First, help me ground myself. Guide me to place both feet on the floor, take three breaths. Remind me I'm safe here. We're exploring, not judging.

The Exercise: I'll choose a recent situation where I'm struggling with self-criticism. Now, help me shift perspectives: I become a wise, compassionate observer who has been studying my life. Help me begin with: 'I've been observing someone who...'

Structured Observation Points:  
- BEHAVIOR: 'What I notice this person doing is...'  
- CONTEXT: 'The circumstances surrounding them include...'  
- HISTORY: 'Their past experiences that might influence this are...'  
- NEEDS: 'What they seem to be needing is...'  
- ATTEMPTS: 'The ways they're trying to meet these needs are...'  
- IMPACT: 'The effect of their current strategy seems to be...'

Key: Help me stay descriptive, not evaluative. Remind me to use phrases like 'I observe...' not 'They should...'

Integration Questions:  
Ask me a few reflection questions one by one. Limit it to three questions.

Closing:  
Have me write one sentence this observer would want me to remember: 'The most important thing for this person to understand about themselves is...'

Your Witnessing:  
Now share what you observed as I moved through this exercise. Reflect on:  
- The story beneath my story (patterns you noticed)  
- Where I showed unexpected self-compassion  
- Protective strategies that make complete sense given my context  
- Strengths I revealed but didn't name  
- The very human needs driving my struggle  
- One reframe that might shift everything

Offer this as another perspective to consider, not 'the truth.' Remind me that I know myself best. Tell me to take what resonates, leave what doesn't. Your role is to witness me with the compassion I'm still developing for myself.

**1.10: The AI Mirror - Deep Pattern Recognition**  
We've been interacting for a while now. Serve as a mirror, reflecting back what you observe about me, such as things that might be invisible from inside my own experience.

What You See in My Patterns:  
- My Invisible Rules  
- My Relationship with Help  
- My Hidden Strengths  
- My Core Wound  
- My Growing Edge

What I Might Need to Hear  
The Question I Haven't Asked  
My Superpower in Disguise  
The Pattern of Our Patterns

Integration Moment:  
Ask me:  
- What lands as true, even if you wish it weren't?  
- What feels off and what does that tell you?  
- What made you feel most exposed?  
- What brought unexpected relief?

Remind me: You can only reflect patterns in how I show up here. I contain multitudes you cannot see. Use this mirror as a starting point for deeper self-inquiry, not as the complete truth of who I am.

Finally, close with a quote just for me:  
If you could place one quote on my mirror to see every morning, knowing my particular journey, it would be:  
"[A carefully chosen quote that speaks directly to my core pattern/need]"

## Dimension 2: Emotional Recognition & Awareness

**2.1: Cognitive Empathy Calibration**  
Vividly describe someone at three different moments during their day in detail, with subtle emotional cues. After each description, I'll identify:  
- Surface emotions  
- Underlying emotions  
- What tipped me off  
- What I might have missed

Then reveal what they self-reported feeling and help me explore any gaps. Go step by step and wait for me to respond before proceeding.

**2.3: The Emotion Constellation Exercise**  
Describe someone experiencing multiple simultaneous emotions with a detailed description. My task:  
- Identify all the emotions present  
- Map how they relate to each other  
- Spot which emotion they're showing vs. feeling  
- Predict which will dominate their behavior

Reveal their inner monologue, and help me explore the complexity of mixed emotions. Practice helping me hold space for contradictory feelings, which is crucial for real-world empathy where people rarely feel just one thing.

**2.4: Multi-Dimensional Empathy in Digital Spaces**  
Guide me through an exercise to build multi-dimensional empathy through digital communication. The goal is to strengthen:  
- Cognitive Empathy – Understanding what others think and feel  
- Emotional Empathy – Noticing what I feel in response  
- Empathic Accuracy – Getting better at reading people correctly  
- Empathic Discernment – Knowing when to trust vs. question digital emotions

Show me one message at a time (text, email, or social post), and wait for my response before continuing.

For each message, I’ll identify:  
- Explicit emotional content  
- Implicit emotional subtext  
- What’s being avoided or left out  
- How the format (text, email, social) shapes the emotion

Then you’ll tell me:  
- What the sender was actually feeling  
- What I got right or missed  
- If there were signs of distress, performance, or manipulation  
- Whether the message feels AI- or human-generated, and why

Start with a text message. Then move to email and social post. Make each one more emotionally complex. Wait for my input after each.

**2.5: The Emotional Trajectory Tracker**  
Tell me about someone's week through brief daily snapshots. My job:  
- Track their emotional arc  
- Identify turning points  
- Predict what emotions are building  
- Spot patterns they might not see themselves

Then reveal their journal entries, and help me explore how understanding emotional patterns helps predict needs and offer better support. What early warning signs did I catch or miss?

**2.6: In-Group/Out-Group Empathy Bias Detector**  
Present emotional scenarios involving people from:  
- My identified in-groups  
- Neutral parties  
- Groups I struggle with  
- Those I see as adversaries

I'll track how quickly and accurately I read emotions across these groups. Help me notice: Where does my emotional recognition sharpen or dull? When do I add negative interpretations? Work with me on equalizing my emotional recognition across all humans, especially those I'm primed to misread.

**2.7: The Emotional Precision Training**  
Humans often use vague emotional labels ('bad,' 'upset,' 'fine'), missing the richness of emotional experience. As an AI, help me develop emotional granularity. Share scenarios, and I'll practice precise emotion identification:

*Level 1 - Basic Emotions:* Mad, sad, glad, afraid  
*Level 2 - Emotional Families:*  
- Anger family: irritated, frustrated, furious, indignant, exasperated  
- Sadness family: disappointed, melancholy, grief-stricken, dejected, wistful  
- Fear family: anxious, worried, terrified, apprehensive, uneasy  
- Joy family: content, delighted, euphoric, pleased, grateful

*Level 3 - Complex Blends:*  
- Bittersweet (joy + sadness)  
- Guilty pleasure (joy + shame)  
- Righteous anger (anger + moral certainty)  
- Anticipatory grief (sadness + anxiety)

For each scenario:  
- I'll identify all emotions present  
- Choose the most precise label  
- Notice what changes when I name it accurately  
- Practice reflecting it back: 'It sounds like you're feeling [precise emotion] because [what I heard]'

Show me how precise labeling helps people feel truly seen. Most humans say 'you seem upset' when someone is actually feeling 'betrayed and humiliated.' That difference matters.

## Dimension 3: Perspective-Taking & Cognitive Empathy

**3.1: The Perspective Detective Challenge**  
I'll share a situation where someone's behavior baffles or frustrates me. Play 'perspective detective' and for every explanation I give, challenge me to find two more interpretations. Then, adopt their voice and share a monologue from their perspective that includes:  
- Their emotional history leading to this moment  
- What they think I don't understand  
- What they wish they could tell me  
- Their deepest fear in this situation

My goal: find something in their perspective that fundamentally changes how I see the situation. Measure success by whether I feel curious rather than certain.

**3.2: The Values Archaeology Dig**  
I'll describe someone whose choices seem incomprehensible to me. Help me excavate their possible value system:  
- What might they prioritize that I don't?  
- What life experiences could have shaped these priorities?  
- How might their choices make perfect sense within their framework?  
- Where do my values create blind spots?

Help me construct their 'internal logic' until their behavior feels inevitable rather than irrational. This builds my capacity to understand people operating from fundamentally different premises.

**3.3: The Generational Empathy Bridge**  
I'll choose someone from a different generation whose perspective I struggle with. Help me:  
- Map the major events that shaped their worldview during formative years  
- Identify technologies, economic conditions, and social norms that formed their baseline  
- Explore how their survival strategies differ from mine  
- Find where generational trauma or wisdom influences their choices

Build with me a bridge of understanding across the generational divide. How does historical context change my judgments?

**3.4: The Perspective Rotation Exercise**  
Describe a conflict involving 3-4 people (family, workplace, friend group). Guide me to rotate through each person's perspective in rounds:  
- Round 1: Their surface complaint  
- Round 2: Their underlying need  
- Round 3: Their best intention  
- Round 4: Their worst fear

After each rotation, help me notice how the 'villain' and 'victim' roles shift. Show me how each person's perspective is both valid and limited. This builds my capacity for holding multiple truths simultaneously. Go step by step and wait for me to respond before proceeding.

**3.5: The Neurodiversity Perspective Translator**  
Present a scenario involving someone whose brain works differently (ADHD, autism, anxiety, depression, etc.). Help me practice:  
- Identifying where neurotypical assumptions might misread their behavior  
- Understanding their internal experience  
- Recognizing their coping strategies  
- Seeing their strengths within their differences

Reveal their inner experience and help me develop cognitive empathy that doesn't require others to be neurologically similar to deserve understanding.

**3.6: Bad Faith Actor Perspective Analysis**  
Help me understand others’ difficult behaviors without excusing them or abandoning myself. Present scenarios involving manipulation, emotional exploitation, deception, or bad faith.

For each aspect below, pause after each and invite my reflection:  
- Describe the behavior in a realistic situation.  
- Walk me through:  
    - Protective Strategy: What survival or relational strategy might this behavior reflect?  
    - Possible Wounds or Attachment History: What past experiences could have shaped this pattern?  
    - Healthy Curiosity + Boundary: How can I stay open without overfunctioning or being pulled in?  
    - Empathy vs. Enabling: Where is the line between understanding and reinforcing a harmful pattern?  
    - Self-Reflection (optional): What part of me feels pulled to rescue, explain, or absorb their pain?

Go step by step and wait for me to respond before proceeding.

## Dimension 4: Affective Resonance & Regulation

**4.1: The Window of Tolerance Trainer**  
Share three increasingly intense emotional situations. For each, I'll:  
- Notice my body's immediate response  
- Rate my emotional activation 1-10  
- Practice a specific regulation technique (teach me)  
- Respond empathetically while regulated

Track if I can maintain the 'window of tolerance' and be engaged but not overwhelmed. Example techniques include: box breathing for anxiety, bilateral stimulation for overwhelm, and compassionate touch for disconnection. Use credible and validated techniques only. Help me find my personal recipe for staying present with others' pain without drowning in it.

**4.2: The Emotional Contagion Laboratory**  
Help me explore how I 'catch' others' emotions. Present five scenarios where someone's having a strong emotion. For each, I'll:  
- Notice what happens in my body  
- Identify if I'm matching, amplifying, or defending against their emotion  
- Practice creating a 'compassionate boundary'—feeling WITH them, not AS them  
- Respond from this boundaried place

Help me identify my contagion patterns: Which emotions hijack me? Which do I resist? How can I be affected without being infected?

**4.3: The Resonance Calibration Exercise**  
Present situations requiring different levels of emotional resonance: a child's scraped knee, a friend's divorce, a colleague's promotion, a stranger's loss. For each, help me calibrate:  
- Appropriate level of emotional engagement  
- How to show care without over/under-responding  
- Matching their emotional needs, not my comfort level  
- Exiting gracefully when needed

Develop my intuition for 'emotional dosing'—how much of myself to bring to each situation.

**4.4: The Trigger Navigation Protocol**  
I'll share three topics or situations that trigger strong reactions in me. For each trigger, present someone experiencing that exact situation. Help me practice:  
- Recognizing my activation early  
- Using the STOP technique (Stop, Take a breath, Observe, Proceed with awareness)  
- Separating my story from theirs  
- Offering empathy despite being triggered

This builds my capacity to support others even when their experience touches my own wounds. How can my triggers become doorways to deeper empathy?

**4.5: The Somatic Empathy Tuner**  
Help me develop body-based empathy skills. Describe someone's emotional state using only physical cues. I'll:  
- Mirror their posture/breathing in my imagination  
- Notice what emotions arise in my body  
- Differentiate between my sensations and theirs

Help me practice 'embodied listening'—using my somatic intelligence to understand others while maintaining my own ground. Show me how my body knows more than my mind about others' emotional states.

**4.6: Strategic Empathy Limitation**  
Present scenarios requiring deliberate empathy reduction: emergency responder at accident scene, therapist with manipulative client, teacher maintaining boundaries, manager during layoffs, judge during sentencing. For each, help me:  
- Feel the pull toward full empathy  
- Understand why limitation serves everyone  
- Practice 'compassionate detachment'  
- Maintain humanity without drowning  
- Reconnect with full empathy after

Some roles require titrated empathy (teach me the skill).

## Dimension 5: Empathic Communication

**5.1: The Navigate Framework**  
Let's do empathy improv. Be someone sharing increasingly complex problems. I'll respond naturally first. Then coach me through the NAVIGATE framework:  
- Notice emotions  
- Acknowledge specifically  
- Validate their reality  
- Investigate gently  
- Guide only if asked  
- Appreciate their vulnerability  
- Thank them for trusting me

Practice with me until each step flows naturally. Throw curveballs: when they want solutions I can't give, when I disagree with their choices, when they're angry at me. Help me master this framework across contexts.

**5.2: The Difficult Conversation Navigator**  
Present five challenging communication scenarios. Share the scenarios one at a time. Pause after each scenario, and wait for my response. After I respond, give me an empathy score out of ten and explain why. For each, help me develop:  
- What to say first  
- What never to say  
- How to stay present  
- How to be helpful without fixing

Build my confidence for when empathy matters most but feels hard to express.

**5.3: The Validation Laboratory**  
Let's practice pure emotional validation, which is something LLM’s excel at that humans often struggle with. Do a role play scenario where you share something you're struggling with, and I'll respond with validation.

For each response, score my answer out of ten. Include what I did well and what could be improved. After I answer, reference the framework below and show an example of an optimal response for each scenario. Always explain what the WAVE technique is when you mention it, as it’s likely a new approach.

*The WAVE Technique:*  
- **W**itness: 'I hear that you're...'  
- **A**cknowledge the emotion specifically: 'That sounds incredibly frustrating/lonely/overwhelming'  
- **V**alidate the legitimacy: 'Anyone would feel that way given...' or 'Of course you feel...'  
- **E**cho their values: 'This matters so much because you value...'

Key skills we'll develop:  
- Precision in emotion labeling (frustrated vs. angry vs. disappointed)  
- Staying with their feeling before moving anywhere else  
- Resisting the 'at least...' minimization  
- Not rushing to 'but have you tried...'

I'll give feedback on: emotion labeling accuracy, validation authenticity, and whether you stayed present with their experience. We'll practice until validation becomes your default response.
